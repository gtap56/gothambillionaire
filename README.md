seeks a helping hand in a personal project to sync several places to make site creation simpler, unified

I need to make an interface which minimally joins these sites

Semrush.com
self hosted WordPress wp-admin 
hirewriters.com

Order article titles, article content, and data entry in single stand alone desktop application

Build a WordPress based keyword-optimized site in fewer clicks.



Use case

Jon wants to build a 150 page website for adsense. He logs in with his account. He creates a site profile for veganfries.com, he sets up semrush, wplogin and editor login, hirewriters logins. He adds $300 to his hirewriters account. Wordpress site is synced and count of posts is updated to reflect what’s up there. Posts 1, word count:0.

 He starts building by searching for his competition’s site’s keywords. He gets 90 and they are added to his queue. They add up to 10948 volume and average competition of .02 percent. He looks up a few more keywords and adds them to the queue, now he has 150 keywords. He saves them(autosaved).

Jon’s title order is next. He reviews the ordering template and submits it to hirewriters. It shows him his remaining balance. After 1 day, his email gets a notice to log into his account to review article titles / send them back. He reviews, makes a few edits to the titles, and accepts. The light turns green on this signpost in the roadmap.

Jon’s article order is next. He confirms the 150 article titles again and the template for ordering states what he wants in each article from the writer. He selects 500 words, the cost of the writing job. He places the order , confirms it. It charges his card via hirewriters. The screen says ‘orders in progress’. An email comes every day notifying him to review new articles. The software automatically downloads completed drafts based on article order numbers, counting until all 150 articles are downloaded at which point it sends an email to him stating his articles are ready for publication. A green light next to article order, indicating it’s time for data entry. There is a counter indicating how many are left.

Jon’s data entry order is simple: he selects the template instructions for the data entry specialist. They will publish the articles using the editor wp account. The options are simple to choose data entry work: he clicks “start publishing” and status states ‘data entry initiated’. If there is a problem, the software will send an email saying there is a question in hirewriters.

The software counts the wordpress posts published since, including word count. It notifies Jon’s email and the software lights up green indicating all posts published, a link to the site is available.

Further steps are indicated on the final screen: ad inject, position ads, add subscription plugin, create newsletter, insert google analytics code, watch traffic and semrush stats grow. Jon is happy to see all the work was easy to track, articles were easy to review and publish, and he spent minimal time logging in.
